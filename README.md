# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction
This repository focuses on building a robust pipeline for predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), a crucial metric that helps businesses understand the total revenue a customer is likely to generate over their relationship with the company. By accurately estimating CLV, businesses can optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and allocate resources effectively.

**Features**
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into customer behavior and revenue patterns.
**Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features such as purchase frequency, average order value, and customer segmentation.
**Machine Learning Models**: Implement regression-based and advanced algorithms, including Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and deep learning methods.
**Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for model evaluation.
**Actionable Insights**: Identify high-value customers and predict future revenue contributions.

**Project Structure**
data/: Raw and processed datasets used for analysis and modeling.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks containing EDA, feature engineering, and modeling workflows.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and utility functions.
models/: Trained models saved for inference and deployment.
reports/: Visualizations and reports generated during the analysis phase.
README.md: Overview of the repository and project details.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if applicable), matplotlib, seaborn
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook
Getting Started

**Dataset**
The dataset includes customer transactional data, purchase history, and behavioral metrics.

**Use Cases**
Customer Segmentation: Identify and target high-value customers.
Marketing Optimization: Allocate budgets effectively by focusing on customers with high predicted CLV.
Revenue Forecasting: Predict future revenue streams for financial planning.

**Future Enhancements**
Incorporation of time-series models for CLV prediction.
Deployment of a real-time CLV prediction API using Flask or FastAPI.
Integration with visualization dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).
